# Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences and movie similarities.
Excited to share my Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.

🔹 Implemented a Content-Based Recommendation Engine using movie metadata such as genres, overview, keywords, cast, and crew.
🔹 Applied text preprocessing, CountVectorizer, and Cosine Similarity to generate accurate recommendations.
🔹 Designed an interactive frontend using Streamlit for real-time user interaction.
🔹 Integrated movie posters using the TMDB API to enhance user experience.

🛠 Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | NLP | Streamlit

🚀 This project helped me understand how real-world recommendation systems work, from data preprocessing to deployment.

## Files

- `Movies Recommendation System.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with the main analysis and model
- `app.py` - Python application file
- `movie_list.pkl` - Serialized movie data
- `similarity.pkl` - Precomputed similarity matrix
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` - Movie credits dataset
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` - Movie details dataset

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis
2. Use `app.py` for the recommendation application

## Dataset

This project uses the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset containing movie information and credits.
